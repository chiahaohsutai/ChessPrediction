## Chess Prediction

This project focused on the construction of a classification model which can predict whether a player will win a chess game. 

A detailed description of the project can be found on the notebook. Unfortunately, the CSV files are too large to have in the repo. However, data processing, cleaning and explorations are included in the notebook. Moreover, all the modelling steps are detailed as well.
